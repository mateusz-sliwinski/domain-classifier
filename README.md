# Domain Classifier
## Task: Domain Classification

### The task involves domain classification.
### In the `Data/` folder, there are two datasets:
### - `benign`: safe domains (label 0)
### - `malware`: unsafe domains (label 1)

## Task:

### 0. Clone the repository to your machine. Fork the project to your Git account.

### 1. Load the dataset, assign labels, and define the data split strategy for training.

### 2. Build a pipeline to prepare the data for training/prediction.

### 3. Train the model/models.

### 4. Choose and present model evaluation metrics.

### 5. Present and describe how the model will perform on "production" data (data not available during training/evaluation).

### Manual Setup

1. Configure and activate the virtual environment I recommend using python at least 3.11.
2. Extract the rar files to the data folder
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. go to the domain_classifier.ipynb file and review or run the code to see how the models work
